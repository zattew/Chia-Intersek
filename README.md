# Chia-Intersek
Program for mapping Chia-Pets data on a genome. That will take three arguments in input in this order: 
1 genome with 5 colums, name of gene, chromosome, strand, start Tss, end Tss, second gene name.
2 left anchor with 3 columns: chromosome, start coordinate, end coordinate.
3 right anchor with 3 columns: chromosome, start coordinate, end coordinate.

The program will create an output in Risultati.txt with long distance interactions for each gene.
